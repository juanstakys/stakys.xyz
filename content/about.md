I am a software developer and systems engineering student, passionate about what I do. I got into programming at 15 with C++, and I haven’t stopped learning since.

I currently specialize in JavaScript/TypeScript, with over 5 years of experience on personal projects and 4 years of formal professional work, implementing agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban using Jira.

My greatest strength is logical thinking, which gives me an edge in the system design process and in applying design patterns.

I have experience on the frontend with React and Vue, and on the backend with Node.js, Express, TypeORM, and a range of database technologies—SQL (such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB) and document-oriented (designed around documents) databases such as MongoDB.

I always approach projects with a proactive attitude, keeping the end user and the scenarios they may encounter in mind.

Because engineering is my passion, I spend much of my free time learning more. I carry that learning over and apply it to projects whenever it’s viable and appropriate. In this way, I continuously improve as a developer and engineer, always building on my previous knowledge and experience.
